  <h2>Game Rules</h2>
  <p>When it's a player turn, the player names a city that starts with the letter the previous city ended with.</p>
  <p>There are two players: you and "the computer". The first letter of your city is already entered, so just type the rest; then press enter or click the "Go!" button.</p>
  <p>You can see the cities that were already used in the "City History", either for a paticular order (sorted) or all (in the order they were called).</p>
